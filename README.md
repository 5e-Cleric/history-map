# Welcome to my project, historyMap

HistoryMap is a web tool to register events in timelines and maps, using your own data, including your own custom date system!

It is built with the MERN stack, current temporarily hosted in Netlify + Render + Mongodb Atlas

## Work In Progress

Right now, i am workin towards completing the MVP of this app, which includes:

-   [x] Have different worlds, a world should include: map, timeline, events, factions?
-   [x] In every world, add events to map, automatically added to timeline
-   [x] For every event, add date, position, title, and description
-   [x] Consult events based on map position, and world date in a timeline
-   [ ] CRUD events and worlds


Even this readme is in progress...
